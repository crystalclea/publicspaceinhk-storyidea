         Hi there, my name is Alan Lam and this is my personal page where I create things. I love to create web pages from scratch and enjoy writing simple but powerful code. At the moment, I am studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley and my interest lies in many areas. For one, I am aspiring to become a patent lawyer in the next decade or so. But for now, when not doing school projects or practicing logic games, I'm working on having an eye for design.
